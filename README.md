Revealing... Transcending 


This app is an Oracle Deck Collection. To play the user choose a deck, then meditate on an answer that he would like to be answered by the universe, then he chooses a card and finally the app shows him the selected card.
The API is custom and is created at firebase.

In this screen the user can select which deck he wants to play with (for now there is only one available):
